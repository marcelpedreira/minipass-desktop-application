.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The Encapsulated Modbus RTU master protocol is implemented in the class \fBMbusRtuOverTcpMasterProtocol\fP. 

It provides functions to establish and to close a TCP/IP connection to the slave as well as data and control functions which can be used after a connection to a slave device has been established successfully. The data and control functions are organized different conformance classes. For a more detailed description of the data and control functions see section \fBData and Control Functions for all Modbus Protocol Flavours\fP.
.PP
Using multiple instances of a \fBMbusRtuOverTcpMasterProtocol\fP class enables concurrent protocol transfers using multiple TCP/IP sessions (They should be executed in separate threads).
